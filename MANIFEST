CHOICES
(You are allowed to choose a feature for some of the requirements. Indicate on the line

-------
9a. I used text-shadow to style the page heading.
9b. I used clamp to dynamically size the font-size on the page.
12. I used css transforms to create a menu overlay for mobile screens. For the second requirement I used an image border to create a rope-pattern border around menu items.
18. I used :after to style text by adding emojies after.

JAVASCRIPT
(Please tells us what the JavaScript does e.g. "click on the green button and it does the following...")
----------
On mobile screens the options in the navigation bar will collapse into a menu button. CLicking the menu button toggles a menu overlay. Clicking the X button on the menu overlay closes the overlay.
